# Double Linked List Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a double linked list in C. The double linked list data structure is implemented with basic operations like insertion at the beginning, insertion at the end, insertion after a specific node, deletion at the beginning, deletion of a specific node, and display in forward and reverse order.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine: 


```bash

git clone git@github.com:KarimZidan007/DOUBLE_LINKEDLIST.git

```
Then, you can compile the code using any C compiler of your choice.


## Usage
The main.c file contains a simple console-based application that demonstrates the usage of the implemented double linked list operations. To run the application:

```bash

gcc main.c -o main
./main

```
Follow the instructions in the console to perform various operations on the double linked list.


## Supported Operations

1-Insert node at the beginning

2-Insert node at the end

3-Insert node after a specific node

4-Get the length of the list

5-Delete node at the beginning

6-Delete specific node

7-Display list in forward order

8-Display list in reverse order
